# hackathon Dec-2020

500 Miles to learn is the winning project of our hackathon challenge made within 24 hours.

The theme for our project was the music "The Proclaimers - I'm Gonna Be (500 miles)", and with that our initial idea was to create a game that somehow has a purpose and with that we decided to create a children's education game.

This game consists of controlling a car in a 3 line road where given a question you have to decide the line where the correct answer is and reach the end of the game after running the 500 miles. 

But there is a catch, you don't have enough gas to complete the journey, the only way to get more gas is to guess the correct answer for each question.

Our purpose with this game is to create a fun environment for children to learn and practice some basic knowledge of maths, science and languages.

We do believe that more and more often our children have access to computers/smartphones earlier in life and we can take advantage of that by introducing them to educational video games.

As we said earlier this game was done within 24h, so we lack many features, but the game base is complete and is available to play in a browser in https://tpleme.github.io/500milesweb.github.io/.
